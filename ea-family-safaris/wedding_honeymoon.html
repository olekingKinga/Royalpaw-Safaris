                <h3>Day 2: Full day game viewing in Masai Mara.</h3>
            <p>One day at Masai Mara is not enough. You will be glad you have this second day to enjoy this 
                part of Kenya. While any time of year is wonderful to visit Africa, those who visit between July 
                and October will see the Great Migration, when zebras, Thomson’s gazelles and wildebeests 
                travel across the Serengeti – it is a massive migration and is truly awe-inspiring. <br />No matter when 
                you visit, you will also have a chance to take a “walking safari”, or visit a local tribal village if you 
                wish. You will learn about the Masai way of life and how they have managed to retain their 
                semi-nomadic customs even in today’s modern world, when so much of their world is at risk. After all these adventures, you will be 
                more than ready for a mid-day nap or laze on the veranda to escape the heat of the day.

            <p> Enjoy your final morning breakfast at Ndutu area. Refresh and check-out of the lodge to depart 
                to Ngorongoro Crater. You will arrive at Ngorongoro Crater in time for lunch at your lodge. After 
                lunch, embark for an afternoon game drive on these landscapes that range from dense mountain forests and woodlands to grasslands, lakes, and swamps. Huge herds of ungulates 
                dominate the crater floor with zebras, wildebeests, elands, Grant’s and Thompson’s gazelles 
                being the species most commonly seen. But the crater is also home to the “big five” and 
                elephants, lions and buffaloes are often spotted. The almost extinct black rhino can also be 
                found in the crate and sightings aren’t rare either. Serval cats, spotted hyenas and jackals are 
                also often seen while cheetahs are more difficult to spot. Later in the evening, return to your 
                lodge/camp for dinner and overnight.

                30,000 large animals within the crater, so you are bound to see lots of wildlife: large herds of 
                wildebeest, antelope and zebras roam the landscape, often being pursued by hyenas, 
                cheetahs or lions. The lake inside the crater is home to numerous colorful bird species, and you 
                can see hippos lounging in the water. Every so often, visitors see impressive bull elephants 
                passing through the crater area in search of water, though herds with cows and calves are rare.

                <h3>Day 11: Game viewing at Amboseli.</h3>
            <p> You will be glad to have another two days at Amboseli National Park as the morning and 
                afternoon game drives offer completely different experiences. The park is home to more than 
                400 bird species as well as wildebeests, zebras, white rhinos and other wildlife – there is no telling 
                what you will see. Every hour of the day is different, and every season of the year is different, 
                which means that every game drive is different, so be sure to have your cameras prepped and 
                ready for some stunning photos and videos in both the morning and afternoon. At mid-day, 
                when the heat drives all of East Africa into the shade, you can lounge in the pool, take a siesta 
                in your comfortable room or meet fellow travelers for a refreshing drink at the bar. An optional 
visit to a tribal village or a walking safari is available.
