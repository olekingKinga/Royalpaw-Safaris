                <h3>Day 2: Nairobi Excursion</h3>
            <p>Breakfast at your hotel, our tour rep will meet you to officially welcome you and give you a brief 
                about your safari. In the mid-morning proceed for a heart-warming visit to the Daphne Sheldrick 
                Elephant Orphanage. Here you will witness the heroic efforts of the dedicated team who 
                rehabilitate orphaned elephant calves and other vulnerable animals. This extraordinary place 
                plays a pivotal role in protecting the wilderness and offers a beautiful experience, as well as the 
                opportunity to adopt an orphaned elephant. Visiting hours for Daphne Sheldrick Elephant is 
                1100-1200 / Private visit 1500 / Foster parents visit 1700 (The last two need advance booking at 
                an extra cost).<br />
                Your next stop will take you to the renowned Giraffe Centre, where you will be given a rare 
                opportunity to get up close to these gentle giants in this natural sanctuary, which was founded 
                by Jock Leslie-Melville, the Kenyan grandson of a Scottish earl, to protect the endangered 
                Rothschild giraffe. You can climb at the top of a platform and stand eye to eye with the giraffes, 
                feed them small pellets or go for a gentle meander on a serene forest trail.<br />
                Break for lunch at a local restaurant. In the afternoon visit the Karen Blixen Museum for a glimpse 
                into the fascinating world of the pioneer coffee farmer, who achieved world fame through her 
                highly acclaimed memoir, “Out of Africa”. She left Africa after a series of personal tragedies and 
                her lovely colonial house has been preserved as a museum. Set in expansive gardens, the Karen 
                Blixen Museum is an interesting place to wander around. Dinner at carnivore restaurant. Return 
                to the hotel for overnight.

                <h3>Day 10 : Serengeti National Park / Ngorongoro Crater- 2 ½ Hrs drive with enroute game.</h3>
            <p> Breakfast at the lodge. Check out with an enroute game drive as you depart Serengeti. 
                Continue to Ngorongoro Crater Conservation Area (NCCA), which features rolling plains, lakes, 
                craters, mountains and dormant volcanoes. Descend into the ‘8th Wonder of the World’, a 
                unique biosphere that has remained virtually unchanged since the dawn of time. Enclosed 
                within its towering walls are grasslands, swamps, forests, saltpans, a fresh water lake and a 
                glorious variety of birdlife. Here too are all the members of the ‘Big Five’ (lion, elephant, rhino, 
                leopard, and buffalo) as well as a large cast of plains game and one of Africa’s densest 
                populations of predators. Enjoy a picnic lunch on the crater floor before driving back to your 
                lodge for relaxation before dinner.

                <h3>Day 11 : Ngorongoro Conservation Area/ Lake Manyara National Park- 45 min to 01 Hr drive.</h3>
            <p> Breakfast at your lodge. Depart with your picnic lunch and head to Lake Manyara National Park.
                The park is truly a photographer's playground and offers some of the best game viewing in the 
                world. You can expect to see many of Africa's most well-known animals, with the tree-climbing 
                lions a particular treat. These proud predators lounge in acacia trees practically begging to be 
                photographed. Bird-watchers will find Lake Manyara is an absolute delight, with a huge variety 
                of birds on display in the park. Even the novice can expect to be amazed by large flamingo 
                flocks, circling birds of prey, and the brightly colored lilac breasted roller. In the early evening 
                check out and drive to Arusha for overnight.

                <h3> Day 13 :  Amboseli National Park.</h3>
            <p> The day starts with an early morning game viewing where you’ll see white rhinos, big tusked 
                elephants, big cats, wildebeests, zebras and many other species. If the skies are clear you will 
                have clear views of the snowcapped Mt. Kilimanjaro. Amazingly, the sites you see in the morning 
                will be quite different from those you’ll see on the afternoon game drive as the various creatures 
                respond to their unique biological clocks. Depending on the time of year, the terrain will vary 
                from snows of Kilimanjaro to the hot dry summer to the life-giving rainy season – but it will always 
                be beautiful. The routes taken will depend on weather conditions but they are all offer 
unforgettable sceneries, so keep your camera ready. Dinner and overnight at the lodge.
